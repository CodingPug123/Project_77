    <h1>Project on Console!</h1>
    <p>VS Code is a coding platform which I use. To start coding, you first create a folder. Name the folder whatever you want, and then open the folder in VS Code. Then, create three files. The first one is html. To create this, type in: index.html. The second file you will create is css. To create this, type in: style.css. The last one is java script. To create this file, type in: main.js. That is how you start coding on VS Code!</p>

    <br>

    <p>Console is used to show the errors in your code, and to display stuff. In this project, if you go to the console, it will display numerous texts and numbers that I put in there.</p>

    <h2>Now...</h2>
    <h2>Open the Console!</h2>
